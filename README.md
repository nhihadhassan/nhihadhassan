## Hi there 👋

I’ve always been drawn to the intersection of finance, technology, and problem-solving. What started as building Excel models in school grew into a career where I now work daily with treasury operations, reconciliations, and financial reporting in fast-moving, regulated environments.

In my current role, I use the Kyriba Treasury Management System alongside SQL, Power BI, and Excel to manage cash, monitor liquidity, and build reports that help leadership make decisions with confidence. I enjoy spotting inefficiencies, building automated solutions, and simplifying complex data so it’s easy for others to act on.

Across roles at Questrade, BMO, and Canadian Tire, I’ve:
	•	Managed end-to-end reporting cycles for liquidity and compliance deliverables
	•	Automated recurring reports in Power BI and Excel, cutting turnaround times
	•	Partnered with Finance, Compliance, Product, and IT to improve workflows
	•	Supported audits and risk management through stronger reporting controls
Colleagues often describe me as the go-to person for making the numbers make sense

I'm currently learning Python.
Outside of work, I am pursuing photography as a creative outlet. 

I’m always open to connecting about treasury, fintech, analytics, or process automation. I’m particularly interested in how technology can reshape finance for the better
